	opens window successfully, reads window dimensions from global vars for now, like the filthy hog that i am
	mac compatibility supplied by https://gist.github.com/cbmeeks/5587a11e7856baf819b7

	render class which takes in vertex data, able to bind to vbo to it, link vert attrib pointers, and bind vao, compile and link const char* shaders, then draw it, and the destructor deletes the appropriate vao and vbo
	right now the render class only interprets vert coords, and color is hardcoded within frag shader
	implemented indexing within "bind" func, makes it so that giving index is optional
	project settings, made "working directory" the same dir containing source

	render class doesnt compile and link shaders for each god damn object anymore
	shader class implemented and utilised in game class
	spent 5 hours trying to figure out why glsl shaders wouldnt apply, then realised that i didnt link the shaders in the shader constructor, nice one idiot
	vertex currently holds coords and colors, render class interprets that and glsl shaders just pass out whats given
	separated drawing vbo and ebo per frame, must be user defined, just for retarded microoptimisation
	render class implements compulsory texture, so vert colours arent really needed, unless it gets used as normals in the future

	went 3d, cant go back, save my soul
	basic 3d, implements mvp matrices within game loop, will probably abstract away
	vert shader multiples m * v * p backwards and spits out those positions
	removed redundant vertex info for colors, since we have textures

	moved model transformations to a per-render object basis
	test out transformations on various Render objects like a little child

	implemented "static" input class that resides within game.h and .cpp, too dumb to make it separate yet, because Input needs a reference to all game objects that need input, for now at least
	player class, which just encapsulates movement and manipulation of view and projection matrices, "movement" aka wasd keys are a bit janky
	circular dependencies are the bane of my feeble existance

	getting into lighting, shader handling is still a bigger mistake than my birth though, will try and get the gist of how to handle it eventually i hope
	render and player class no longer send the uniforms to the shaders, now done within main loop, temporary till i can encapsulate this uniform sending process

	got phong shading to work with ambient, diffuse and specular highlights
	still to dumb to be able to extract model position from its model matrix

	thats cause you cant, idiot, needs to find center (or approx) of geometry, easiest method was just finding the middle of the min bounding box
	phong shading already worked, but now moving light sources work too since i can get their approx position based on the transformations applied to it
	wondered why the pos was stuck at 0, then i realised my w multiplier was set to 0.0f, nice one najibian foogol

TODO:
	implement normals in the Vertex struct in globals.h
	implement proper input class instead of being a procrastinating dumbo and having it clogging the main game cpp
	add multitexturing support
	fix up player WASD movement and stuttering
