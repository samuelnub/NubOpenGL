	render class which takes in vertex data, able to bind to vbo to it, link vert attrib pointers, and bind vao, compile and link const char* shaders, then draw it, and the destructor deletes the appropriate vao and vbo
	right now the render class only interprets vert coords, and color is hardcoded within frag shader
	implemented indexing within "bind" func, makes it so that giving index is optional

TODO:
	read glsl shaders from separate file instead of reading it from a const char* like a stupid cucc
	implement normals and uv members in the Vertex struct in globals.h
	implement proper input class instead of being a procrastinating dumbo
